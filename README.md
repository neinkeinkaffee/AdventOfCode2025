# Women in Rust - Advent of Code 2025 🎄🦀
Welcome to the Women in Rust Advent of Code 2025 repository! Here you'll find Rust project templates for each day of the Advent of Code challenge.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. There are 12 puzzles this year! These puzzles range in difficulty and can be used for:
- Interview preparation
- Learning a new programming language
- University coursework
- Practice problems
- Friendly competition

We are going to use this brilliant and festive opportunity to learn and practice Rust together. 

## Repository Structure

This repository contains 12 Rust projects:
```
advent_of_code_2024/
├── puzzle_01/
├── puzzle_02/
├── puzzle_03/
...
└── puzzle_12/
```

Each project is a basic Cargo project with no external dependencies.
